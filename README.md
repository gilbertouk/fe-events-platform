<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Events Platform Front-Endüëã</h1>

<p> Events Platform Front-End: A platform where a business can share their events with members of the community, and community members can sign up and optionally pay to participate in the events. </p>
<p>
This project is a single page application built using React JS with a responsive mobile-first design, making request to an RESTful API with optimistic rendering and error handling.
</p>

> Please note: The application may take a few minutes to load as it waits for the backend to respond due to the BE hosting service shutting down after periods of inactivity.
